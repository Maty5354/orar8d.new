# 🚀 PROJECT SPECIFICATION: TODO LIST OVERHAUL

## 1. 📂 FOLDER SYSTEM
**Goal**: Organize tasks into customizable categories.
*   [x] **Data Model**:
    *   `Folder` entity: `{ id, name, icon (emoji/lucide), color (hex), description }`.
    *   `Task` entity update: Add `folderId`.
*   [x] **Features**:
    *   Create custom folders with user-selected icons and colors.
    *   Edit/Delete folders.
    *   "All Tasks" default view vs. Folder-specific views.
    *   Sidebar or Tab navigation for folders.

## 2. ➕ ADVANCED TASK CREATION (The "Add" Panel)
**Goal**: Replace inline input with a robust task composition interface.
*   [x] **UI Component**: Slide-over panel or centered Modal.
*   [x] **Fields**:
    *   **Header**: Task Title (Large input).
    *   **Folder**: Dropdown/Select to assign a folder.
    *   **Details**:
        *   Description (Text area with link/notes support).
        *   Subtasks: Dynamic list of toggleable items (`{ id, text, isCompleted }`).
    *   **Metrics (Bar Selectors)**:
        *   Priority: [Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High].
        *   Difficulty: [Very Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard].

## 3. 🔔 NOTIFICATIONS & REMINDERS
**Goal**: Omnichannel alerts for tasks.
*   [x] **In-App Toasts**:
    *   Trigger visual toast when a task is due or overdue while the app is open.
*   [x] **Push Notifications**:
    *   Request browser permissions (`Notification.requestPermission`).
    *   Interval-based check to trigger system notifications on Desktop/Mobile.
*   [x] **Logic**:
    *   Background interval checking (`useEffect`).
    *   Compare due dates against current time.
